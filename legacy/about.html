          <h1>Soundtracking main-stage moments with melodic fire.</h1>
          <p>
            Raised in Malmö, Sweden and now rooted in the Bay Area, Noa Tomas channels big room
            and progressive house energy with sweeping pads, emotional hooks, and drops built for
            that collective breath before the lights explode. The mission is simple: build a
            shared moment with the crowd that lingers long after the final kick hits.

          <strong>Emotional weight, main stage scale.</strong> Raised in Malmö, Sweden and now
          living in the Bay Area, Noa’s sound leans toward big room and progressive house, melodic,
          uplifting, and full of kinetic drive. Each set is crafted to feel personal even as it
          rips through festival systems. He’s been testing unreleased tracks and custom live edits
          that connect in clubs across Scandinavia and California, and he’s ready to bring that
          feeling to San Francisco. Expect soaring leads, widescreen breakdowns, and drops that
          feel like the lights turning from dusk to neon.
