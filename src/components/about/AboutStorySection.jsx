      <strong>Emotional weight, main stage scale.</strong> Raised in Malmö, Sweden and now living in the Bay Area, Noa's sound
      leans toward big room and progressive house, melodic, uplifting, and full of kinetic drive. Each set is crafted to feel
      personal even as it rips through festival systems. He's been testing unreleased tracks and custom live edits that connect
      in clubs across Scandinavia and California, and he's ready to bring that feeling to San Francisco. Expect soaring leads,
      widescreen breakdowns, and drops that feel like the lights turning from dusk to neon.
