# DGME169 Final Project 

The repo was originally created under `bennettdcsm/DGME169_Noa-M`, but because I don't have access to the repository settings I cannot enable or configure GitHub Pages for the original project. GitHub Pages only serves what is configured in **Settings → Pages**, and without permissions the build can’t be deployed there.

## Live deployment

To keep the site accessible, I deployed the compiled build through Vercel. You can view the live site there:

```
https://dgmenoa-m1.vercel.app/
```

## Fork

I also forked the project to my own account so that I can manage deployments without needing permissions on the original repository:

- Forked repo: https://github.com/nmandorf/dgme_noa-m1

In the fork, GitHub Pages can be configured via Settings because I own that repository. The fork mirrors all source files from this repo, so any updates should be pushed to both if you want the Vercel deployment and the forked GitHub Pages deployment to stay in sync.
